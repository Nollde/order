class typed(property):
    """
    Shorthand for the most common property definition. Can be used as a decorator to wrap around
    a single function. Example:

    .. code-block:: python

         class MyClass(object):

            def __init__(self):
                self._foo = None

            @typed
            def foo(self, foo):
                if not isinstance(foo, str):
                    raise TypeError("not a string: '%s'" % foo)
                return foo

        myInstance = MyClass()
        myInstance.foo = 123   -> TypeError
        myInstance.foo = "bar" -> ok
        print(myInstance.foo)  -> prints "bar"

    In the exampe above, set/get calls target the instance member ``_foo``, i.e. "_<function_name>".
    The member name can be configured by setting *name*. If *setter* (*deleter*) is *True* (the
    default), a setter (deleter) method is booked as well. Prior to updating the member when the
    setter is called, *fparse* is invoked which may implement sanity checks.
